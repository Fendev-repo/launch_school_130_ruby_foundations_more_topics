# Assignment: TodoList#each

Given our final Todo and TodoList classes from the previous assignment, implement a TodoList#each method. This method should behave similarly to the familiar Array#each, and the each method we built ourselves in an earlier example. The TodoList#each should take a block, and yield each Todo object to the block.
